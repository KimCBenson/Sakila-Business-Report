# Sakila-Business-Report

## What is this project?
This repository is a project that I did for my Database Management Systems (CSI-300) Course. In it, I queried the Sakila Database, which is a multi-table database included with MySQL as a sample database that acts as a fictional movie rental store. Using Python, I wrote SQL queries that I then used to create data visualizations with Matplotlib. These visualizations can be found in the business report.

I then collaborated with a group of 2 other people to write a ~17 page business report. This report utilizes the visualizations and makes business recommendations based on store revenue, top actors, and rental counts.

## Files
Sakila Business Report.pdf - PDF that contains the business report. Approximatrly ~17 pages and written with 2 other people.
database_queries_visualizations.py - Python file that uses the mysql.connector, pandas, and matplotlib libraries to query the database and create visualizations for it.
